## Go Training
This is a 1 hour accelerated style course for existing developers who are looking to gain a working understanding of Go.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## Hour 1
In this hour we take our initial tour of the language. We learn about variables, types, data structures and interfaces. We also explore what is idiomatic and how the language is very orthogonal. This includes following the community standards for coding and style.
