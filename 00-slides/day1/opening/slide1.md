## Special Features Of Go

I may be biased but I truly believe Go is an amazing language. It balances between being a lower level language with all the features that modern languages have today to help make you more productive. In Go you can write less code and do so much more. Here are some other special features about the language.

#### * Go comes with a robust standard library.

#### * Go works on a multitude of platforms.

#### * Go code is statically compiled so deployment is trivial.

#### * Go comes with a complete set of documentation.

#### * Go comes with a tool to test, profile and benchmarks your code.

#### * Go can interact with C libraries via cgo.
