## Special Features Of Go - [Caleb Doxsey](http://www.doxsey.net/blog/go-and-assembly/)

* Go's compiler is fast
* Go comes with a robust standard library
* Go works on a multitude of platforms
* Go comes with a complete set of documentation available from the command line / a local web server / the internet
* All Go code is statically compiled so deployment is trivial
* The entirety of the Go source code is available for perusal in an easy format online (like this)
* Go has a well defined (and documented) grammar for parsing. (unlike C++ or Ruby)
* Go comes with a package management tool. go get X (for example go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket)
* Like all languages Go has a set of style guidelines, some enforced by the compiler (like Uppercase vs lowercase) and others merely conventional, but it also has a tool to clean up code: gofmt name_of_file.go.
* And there's also go fix which can automatically convert Go code designed for earlier versions to newer versions
* Go comes with a tool to test packages: go test /path/to/package. It can do benchmarks too.
* Go is debuggable and can be profiled.
* Did you know there's a playground to try out Go online?
* Go can interact with C libraries via cgo.
