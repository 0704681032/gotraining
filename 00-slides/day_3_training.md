## Go Training - Day 3
On this day we continue go deeper into Go. We learn about concurrency patterns, testing, benchmarking, debugging, logging, encoding, io, and reflection.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
