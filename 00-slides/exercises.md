## Go Training Exercises

### Day 1

On this day we take a tour of the language. We learn the keywords, built-in functions and syntax. We also explore what is idiomatic and how the language is very orthogonal. This includes following the community standards for coding and style.

## Day 2

On this day we learn how to use Go to build a full application. The program implements functionality that can be found in many Go programs being developed today. The program pulls different data feeds from the web and compares the content against a search term. The content that matches is then displayed to the terminal window. The program reads text files, makes web calls, decodes both XML and JSON into struct type values and finally does all of this using Go concurrency to make things fast.
