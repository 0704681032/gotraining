## Named Types - Language Syntax - Exercises
Named types are another way to create user defined types. They provide some interesting feature/functionality that is not always available in other languages. The standard library in Go used named types very effectively.

### Code Review

[Declare, create and initalize named types](example1/example1.go) ([Go Playground](http://play.golang.org/p/UKKDife-Wb))

[Named types in the standard library](example2/example2.go) ([Go Playground](http://play.golang.org/p/XnNUdf_cjh))

[Named types and conversion I](example3/example3.go) ([Go Playground](http://play.golang.org/p/Y7gqBwo7Vg))

[Named types and conversion II](example4/example4.go) ([Go Playground](http://play.golang.org/p/gsoqhIUtvw))

### Exercise 1
Declare a named type called counter with a base type of int. Decalre and initalize a variable of this named type to its zero value. Display the value of this variable and the variables type.

### Exercise 2
Declare a named type called counter with a base type of int. Declare a variable called value of type int and assign the value of 10. Declare a variable of the named types and assign the value of the value variable.
