Functions Exercises
==========

### Exercise 1
Declare a struct type to maintain information about a user. Declare a function that creates and returns pointers of this type and an __error__ value. Then write a __main__ function that tests this function.  

### Exercise 2
Change the __main__ function in the last exercise to ignore the error value being returned from the function.

### Exercise 3
Write a program that declares a function that causes a panic. Trap the panic in the function and display the error. Write a __main__ function to test the function.
