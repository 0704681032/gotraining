Packaging Exercises
==========

### Exercise 1
Create a package that exports functions that can be used to perform simple math operations (add, subtract, multiplication and division). Write a program that uses this package to perform and display these mathematical operations. 

### Exercise 2
Create a package with an unexported struct type with exported fields. Then in the package declare an exported factory function called __New__ to create and return pointers of this unexported type. Write a program that uses this package to create values of this type, then initialize and display those values.
