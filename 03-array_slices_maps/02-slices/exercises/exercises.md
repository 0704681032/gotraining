# Arrays, Slices and Maps - Exercises

## Slices

### Exercise 1
Declare a nil slice of integers. Create a loop that increments a counter variable by 10 five times and appends these values to the slice. Iterate over the slice and display each value.

### Exercise 2
Declare a slice of five strings and initialize the slice with string literal values. Take a slice of the first, second and third elements and display the index position and value of each element for both slices.

### Exercise 3
Declare a slice of five strings and initialize this slice with string literal values. Take a slice of the second element with a capacity of one. Display the length and capacity of the slice. Iterate over the slice and display the address and value of each element. Append a new value to the slice and display everything again.
