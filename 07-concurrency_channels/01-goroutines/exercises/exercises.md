# Goroutines - Concurrency and Channels

### Code Review

[Goroutines and concurrency](../example1/example1.go)

[Goroutine time slicing](../example2/example2.go)

[Goroutines and parallelism](../example3/example3.go)

### Exercise 1
Review the provided program that will be used for future exercises. Program uses a function type and closures to create a recursive call that maintains its own state to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
[Starter Program](exercise.go)

### Exercise 2
From exercise 1, convert the recursive call to using goroutines.
