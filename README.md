## Testimonials

Todd Rafferty ([@webrat](https://twitter.com/webRat))  
_"I highly recommend William Kennedy / Ardan Lab for Go Training. William is extremely passionate about the Go language and his energy feeds into his training. Very professional, very informative. My favorite section of his training, if I had to pick, was the segment on MultiWriters. I highly recommend a 3 day course, over a 2 day course. Even after the classes were over, William was always responsive with additional questions via various social media channels."_

Georgi Knox ([@GeorgiCodes](https://twitter.com/GeorgiCodes))  
_"The Intro to Go Workshop enabled me to come into class with very little knowledge of Go and leave having a firm grasp of the key concepts of the language. Each topic was followed up with hands-on coding problems which helped to solidify what I was learning. My teacher Bill was not only approachable, but very excited about the language and his enthusiasm was contagious. I enjoyed that we talked about some of the lower level implementation details of Go which was something that I had found lacking from some books on the language. Overall I would highly recommend this workshop to anyone looking to learn Go quickly and effectively."_

Jackie Heitzer ([@JackieHeitzer](https://twitter.com/JackieHeitzer))  
_"Great course and a perfect introduction to Go.  Bill is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the Go language and I am excited to speak with him about Go in the future.  The training had an excellent format with hands on coding examples.  After the class I feel as though I have a better understanding of the key concepts, especially how pointers work.  I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about Go."_
