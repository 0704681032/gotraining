## Go Training Classes
Training is broken into hourly and daily classes. The length of the class will determine which material is covered and whether exercises are used and to what extent.

## Pricing

Corporate full day training classes are at $2,500 USD a day plus travel expenses. Corporate and group sponsors can have as many students in the class as they like. I recommend limiting it to 25 students or less.

Individual enrollment classes are scheduled periodically and cost $500 per student plus fees. There is a class scheduled for Miami on November 21st/22nd 2014:
