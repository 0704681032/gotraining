## Go Training Classes
Training is broken into hourly and daily classes. The length of the class will determine which material is covered and whether exercises are used and to what extent.

_Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class._
