Training is broken into hourly and daily classes. The length of the class will determine which material is covered and whether exercises are used and to what extent.

_Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class._

## Testimonials

Todd Rafferty ([@webrat](https://twitter.com/webRat))  
_I highly recommend William Kennedy / Ardan Lab for Go Training. William is extremely passionate about the Go language and his energy feeds into his training. Very professional, very informative. My favorite section of his training, if I had to pick, was the segment on MultiWriters. I highly recommend a 3 day course, over a 2 day course. Even after the classes were over, William was always responsive with additional questions via various social media channels._

Corporate full day classes are at $3,500 USD a day plus travel expenses. Corporate and group sponsors can have as many students in the class as they like. I recommend limiting it to 25 students or less.
