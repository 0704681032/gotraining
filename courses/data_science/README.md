## Go for Data Science
This is material for scientists, analysts, and developers who have some experience with Go and statistics and want to learn how to do data science with Go. We believe these classes are perfect for data scientist interested in working in Go or Go programmers interested in doing data science.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## Introduction to Data Science
This material introduces the basic principles and procedures of data science and motivates the use of Go in the context of data science.  Once you are done with this material you will understand what data science is and how Go can help data scientists maintain integrity in the applications they develop.
