## Hardcore Go
Hardcore Go is a 5 day class for any intermediate-level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Goâ€™s type system, concurrency, channels, testing, standard library and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

### Day 1
On this day we take our initial tour of the language. We learn about variables, types, data structures and OOP. We also explore what is idiomatic and how the language is very orthogonal. This includes following the community standards for coding and style.

#### Language Syntax

[Type Conversions](../../topics/type_conversions/readme.md) | 
[Functions](../../topics/functions/readme.md)

#### Data Structures

### Day 3
On this day we continue go deeper into Go. We learn about channels, concurrency patterns, testing, benchmarking, debugging.

#### Concurrency Part II

___

### Day 4
On this day we continue to go deeper into Go and learn about the standard library. We focus on logging, reflection and the io package.

#### Standard Library
[Logging](../../logging/readme.md) | 
[Reflection](../../reflection/readme.md) | 
[IO](../../writers_readers/readme.md)
___

### Day 5
On this day we learn about the encoding and http packages that are part of the standard library.

#### Standard Library
