## Hardcore Go - Standard Library
This class is a 2 day class for any intermediate-level developer who has taken the Hardcore Go language class. The class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view of the standard library. We focus on the http and io packages but this requires looking at other packages that work together.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
