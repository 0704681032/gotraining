## Classification - Decision Trees

In addition to kNN, decision tree and random forest algorithms are widely used for classification problems.  In a decision tree algorithm, a tree of if/then statements is created based on the features and labeled points of a training set.  In a random forest algorithm, many decision trees are built and the results are combined (a type of "ensemble" model). In these examples, we will explore individual Decision trees.
