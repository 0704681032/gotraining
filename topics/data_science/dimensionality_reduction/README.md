## Dimensionality Reduction

Data scientists use dimensionality reduction to transfrom high-dimensional data sets into more compact, low-dimensional data sets.  This process can be very useful when there is redundancy and correlation between features, when a data set includes irrelevant features, and when computational or modeling constraints necessitate lower dimensions.
