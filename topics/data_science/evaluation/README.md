## Evaluation

Being able to properly evaluate a model is essential. Without evaluation, the model development process is just guess work.  Evaluation helps us find the best model to make a prediction and gives us an idea about how the model should perform in the future. represents our data and how well the chosen model will work in the future. A whole variety of evaluation metrics have been developed and not all evaluation metrics are relevant to all models.  We will explore a sampling of these metrics/scores here, but, as data scientists, it is very important to evaluate the metrics/scores you are using on a case by case basis.
