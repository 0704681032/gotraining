## Hypothesis Testing

While working as a data scientist, you will encounter the need to test many hypotheses.  For example, you may want to know if a change to a website produced more email registrations, or you may want to know if a new model is actually performing better than an old model. These hypotheses must must be testable for you to actually come to some conclusion. In other words, there must be some way of determining if your hypothesis explains an observation.
