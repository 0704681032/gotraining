## Maintaining Integrity in Data Science Applications

Integity in data science applications is crucial, because data science applications exist to provide data-driven insights.  As soon as the integrity of a data science application breaks down, people lose trust in the output and, as a result, will refuse to make decisions based on the output.  Go helps us maintain integrity in terms of reproducibility and deployment, which are common struggles for data scientists.
