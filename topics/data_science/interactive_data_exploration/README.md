## Interactive Data Exploration

In the first stages of a data science project, you may not understand what the data looks like or the implications of certain analyses.  Thus, it can be extremely valuable to be able explore data interactively and develop analyses through some trial and error (implementing those later in a robust application).  The most common tool utilized for this type of exploratory data analysis is [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.  These notebooks allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  Here we will use Go in Jupyter notebooks recreating some of our previous data parsing interactively.

## Notes

* Programming in notebooks can be extremely valuable in an exploratory phase of a project, but necessarily produces bad code.
* Because notebooks can include pictures, equations, live code, and more, notebooks can be effectively used to explain methodology and give reports/presentations.
* The Jupyter ecosystem is very active and includes many interesting projects other than just the notebook.
