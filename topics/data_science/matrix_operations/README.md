## Matrix Operations, Linear Algebra

As mentioned, matrix operations are ubiquitous in the data science world.  Most machine learning algorithms and many statistical/modeling techniques rely on iterative matrix operations including solving for eigenvalues/vectors, finding determinants, taking transposes, and more.  We will highlight a few here, such that you can have confidence in implementing your own custom models and understand various pre-existing implementations.
