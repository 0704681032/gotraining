## Validation

Even if you evaluate a model, how can you have any confidence that your model will generalize to data that you have yet to encounter?  In fact, unless you explicitly take steps to "validate" this generalization of the model, you will likely end up with a model that only described the data that was used for "training" (or the model is "overfit").  A variety of validation methods exist, and, as a data scientist, you should be very careful to utilize one or more of these methods to ensure that your model generalizes.
